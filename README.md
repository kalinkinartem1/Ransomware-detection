A system for detection cryptographic ransomware based on event registration and analysis for Windows OS
The work is devoted to the development of a system for detecting encryption programs based on event registration using ETW and further event analysis using a machine learning device for Windows OS. The paper analyzed recent attacks by cryptographic programmers. As a result of the analysis, the main file manipulations were identified, the increase in the number of which is used in the work as an indicator that contributes to the detection of encryption programs, and the peculiarity of the work of encryption programs was also revealed. Further, a comparative analysis of existing methods of detecting encryption programs was carried out, as a result of the analysis, it was decided to use a machine learning device to solve the problem of finding anomalies. To determine the best algorithm, the following algorithms were tested: OneClassSVM, IsolationForest, LocalOutlierFactor. The IsolationForest algorithm showed itself in the best way, which is used as the main one in the developed system for detecting encryption programs. Also, in order to train and test the model, it was necessary to create a dataset with sets of actions generated using ETW, for legitimate processes and processes of encryption programs. In this regard, software has been developed that implements algorithms for working with the file system, based on popular attacks by encryption software (SFS), and an algorithm has been added to conceal malicious activity by simulating the work of legitimate software. 30% of the created dataset was used to train the model, 70% for testing. Next, the detection system was tested. During testing on real attacks of encryption programs, WannaCry and TeslaCrypt were discovered. Next, the system was tested for false positives, the following legitimate software was used for this: VeraCrypt, TrueCrypt, 7z, Oracle DBMS, disk optimization and user actions with files, such as renaming files, reading a file, writing to a file. No false positives were detected during testing. The software implementation is performed in the PyCharm development environment for the Windows 10 operating system, but can also be parried on Windows 11, Windows 7.
